# Better WBW - AI Project Rules

## Core Principles
- Follow the "TrainMore" aesthetic: High contrast, Industrial, Dark Mode.
- Frontend: Vue 3 (Composition API), Vite, Pinia, Tailwind CSS.
- Backend: Flask, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL.
- Logic: Debt simplification for WBW settlement.
- OCR: Local EasyOCR for receipts.

## UI/UX Standards
- Theme: Black (#000000), White (#FFFFFF), Brand Red (#E30613), Industrial Gray (#1A1A1A).
- Font: Oswald (Industrial sans-serif).
- Interactions: Slick animations, modal-based detail views, tactile feedback on actions.

## Development Best Practices
- Keep components small and focused.
- Use `defineModel` for two-way bindings.
- Favor `const` over `let`.
- No `as any` or `@ts-ignore` in TypeScript (when used).
- Self-documenting code over excessive comments.

## Feature Logic
- WBW: Transactions must support multi-user splits with weights (e.g., someone paying for 2 people).
- Settlement: Minimize transactions using simplified debt algorithms.
